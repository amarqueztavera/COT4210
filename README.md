Projects from Discrete Structures 2 - Fall 2024

This class was incredibly important for the understanding of computer sctructures. Most surprisingly, a lot of the people that I learned about, for example Chomsky, was so interdisciplimary that I could discuss his theories with psychology and speech pathology students. I learned about DFAs, normal form, minimizing, turing machines, and more.
